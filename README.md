# Social Network API: Mongoose & MongoDB
## Introduction
Social Network API built with Mongoose and MongoDB. Using CRUD operations, this API allows the user to create and manage users, create thoughts, and navigate through the thoughts and add reactions to them. 

## Description
- The primary motivation behind creating this API was to leverage and enhance my skills in utilizing Mongoose and MongoDB, ultimately developing a backend API that mirrors the functionality of a social network application.
- This application was created using Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, and Moment for timestamp functionality.
- This application serves as a testament to my ability to seamlessly connect Mongoose models to MongoDB. Through this integration, Insomnia can efficiently leverage CRUD methods, offering comprehensive data management capabilities.
- During and after the development of this application, I can confidently say that my skills in using Mongoose have increased substantially, and I have also enhanced my proficiency in controllers and routes.
